Tesla Stock Alert Bot on WhatsApp 📈📉🚨

Hey! I built this simple Python script that keeps an eye on Tesla ($TSLA) stock prices every day. If the price moves more than 1% (up or down), it grabs the latest news headlines about Tesla and sends me a nice alert straight to WhatsApp using Twilio. Super handy for staying updated without checking apps all the time!

What It Does

1. Pulls daily stock data from Alpha Vantage

2. Calculates the percentage change and adds a fun trend emoji (📈 for up, 📉 for down)

3. Fetches the top 3 recent news articles from NewsAPI

4. Formats everything neatly and sends it via WhatsApp

5. Includes proper logging and error handling so it doesn't crash on bad days
